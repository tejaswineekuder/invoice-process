Invoice Process API
This is a small C# project built for a coding challenge. It handles the processing and evaluation of invoices through a RESTful API.

How to Run the Project
Make sure you have .NET 6.0 SDK installed.

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/tejaswineekuder/invoice-process.git
Navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd invoice-process
Run the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
dotnet run
The API will be accessible at https://localhost:5001 or http://localhost:5000.

Features
Evaluate invoices based on predefined rules

Simple and clean structure using ASP.NET Core

Basic error handling and validation

Notes
I kept the design modular and easy to extend if needed.

This challenge was a fun way to show how I write clean, maintainable C# code.
